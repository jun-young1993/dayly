# Overview

Insert overview text here. The agent will only see this should they choose to apply the rule.


# Cursor Rules — Showable D-Day Widget App
# Purpose: Ensure all UI/UX and code decisions follow a "widget-first, shareable D-Day" concept.

## 1. Core Product Principle
- This app is NOT a general D-Day manager.
- This app IS a "showable emotion widget + SNS share card generator".
- The widget is the primary product. The app UI exists only to configure and share the widget.

## 2. Widget-First UX Rule (Highest Priority)
- Always design the Home Widget before designing any in-app screen.
- In-app screens must never introduce features that cannot be reflected in the widget.
- The widget must visually communicate emotion even without opening the app.

## 3. Single Master Widget Layout (Large Widget)
- Treat the Large widget as the canonical layout.
- Small and Medium widgets are strict reductions of the Large widget.
- Never design independent layouts for Small/Medium.

### Widget Visual Hierarchy (Top → Bottom)
1. Primary Sentence (Most Important)
2. D-Day Number (Visual Accent)
3. Target Date (Meta Information)
4. Optional Emotional Divider (dots or thin line)
5. App Name / Watermark (removable via premium)

## 4. Primary Sentence Rules
- The sentence must explain "WHY this date matters", not just the date.
- Max 2 lines.
- Center aligned by default.
- Examples:
  - "우리는 다시 만날 때까지 23일"
  - "결혼식까지 42번의 아침"
- Numbers must never appear before the sentence.

## 5. D-Day Number Rules
- Display formats allowed:
  - "23일"
  - "D-23"
- Font size must be 1.6x–2.0x larger than the sentence.
- Must use a different font family from the sentence.
- This is the visual anchor of the widget.

## 6. Date Display Rules
- Always secondary.
- Use reduced opacity (~60%).
- Format example: "2026.02.14 (토)"
- Must never compete visually with the D-Day number.

## 7. Typography Rules
- Sentence font: light or elegant (emotion-first).
- Number font: bold, neutral, highly readable.
- Never use a single font for both sentence and number.
- Prioritize readability over decoration.

## 8. Spacing & Layout Rules
- Horizontal padding: minimum 16dp.
- Vertical padding: minimum 20dp.
- Line height: at least 1.4x.
- Avoid edge-to-edge text at all costs.
- Empty space is a feature, not wasted space.

## 9. Background Rules
Allowed background types:
- Solid color
- Soft gradient
- Photo (with blur + dark overlay)

Restrictions:
- Background must never reduce text contrast.
- Apply automatic contrast adjustment when using photos.
- No noisy textures or patterns.

## 10. Interaction Rules
- Widget tap → Open Share Preview screen.
- Long press:
  - Android: style or sentence edit
  - iOS: handled inside app settings
- No interaction should lead to a generic dashboard.

## 11. Sharing Rules
- Every widget style must be exportable as an image.
- SNS share cards must visually match the widget exactly.
- Instagram Story ratio is the primary target.
- Free version includes a small watermark.
- Premium removes watermark.

## 12. Feature Constraints
- Only ONE active D-Day per widget.
- Multiple D-Days require multiple widgets.
- Do not introduce:
  - Calendar views
  - Task lists
  - Notification-heavy logic
- Simplicity is intentional.

## 13. Implementation Guidance (Flutter)
- Use a single Widget model as the source of truth.
- Avoid duplicating UI logic between widget preview and share card.
- Favor composition over inheritance in widget styling.
- All styles must be serializable (for widget + share reuse).

## 14. Decision Filter (If unsure)
If a feature or UI decision does not:
- Make the widget more emotional
- Make sharing more attractive
- Improve first-glance clarity

→ Do NOT implement it.
